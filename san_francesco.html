    <h1>Saint Francis of Assisi (San Francesco d'Assisi)</h1>
    <p>Saint Francis of Assisi (San Francesco d'Assisi) had a profound influence on Italian art, especially during the Middle Ages and the Early Renaissance. His life, based on humility, poverty, and love for all living beings, became a source of inspiration for numerous painters, sculptors, and architects.</p>
    <p>Italian works of art dedicated to Francis often depict scenes from his life, miracles, stigmata, and moments of spiritual insight. The frescoes created in the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi played an especially important role. These works became key in the development of Italian painting, marking the beginning of a more realistic and emotional depiction of the human figure and sanctity.</p>
    <p>The artworks honoring Francis are characterized by deep spiritual content, expressive faces, attention to nature, and interaction between the saint and the surrounding world. They also reflect the values of the Franciscan order—poverty, compassion, rejection of materialism, and spiritual brotherhood.</p>
    <p>The artistic images of Francis became symbols of religious devotion and humanistic ideals, forming an essential part of Italian cultural and artistic tradition.</p>
    <p><strong>Italian artists who depicted Saint Francis:</strong> Giotto di Bondone, Cimabue, Simone Martini, Pietro Lorenzetti, Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Duccio di Buoninsegna, Fra Angelico, Benozzo Gozzoli, Donatello, Andrea della Robbia, Titian (Tiziano Vecellio), Caravaggio (in later Baroque period).</p>
