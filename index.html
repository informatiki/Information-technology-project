        Our project builds upon the Italian ArCo database, aiming to enrich and expand its content. We focused specifically on artworks depicting religious figures such as saints, the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others. These works of art hold significant cultural and historical importance for Italy and play a crucial role in academic research, providing insights into religious, social, and artistic traditions.<br><br>
        To assess the level of detail in ArCo’s classification of these artworks, we developed SPARQL queries and applied various prompting techniques to thoroughly challenge the ArCo dataset.<br><br>
        During this process, we identified several gaps and omissions. To address these, we leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to deepen our understanding of the subject matter. The knowledge extracted from LLMs was then transformed into new triples intended to enhance and broaden the ArCo database.<br><br>
