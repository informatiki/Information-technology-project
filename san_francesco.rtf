These works became key in the development of Italian painting, marking the beginning of a more realistic and emotional depiction of the human figure and sanctity.</p>\

They also reflect the values of the Franciscan order\'97poverty, compassion, rejection of materialism, and spiritual brotherhood.</p>\
    <p>The artistic images of Francis became symbols of religious devotion and humanistic ideals, forming an essential part of Italian cultural and artistic tradition.</p>\
