  <h1>Santa Maria Maddalena (Mary Magdalene)</h1>
  <p>Saint Mary Magdalene (Santa Maria Maddalena), a pivotal figure in Christian tradition, has profoundly influenced Italian art from the Middle Ages through the Baroque period. Her portrayal in art reflects themes of repentance, spiritual transformation, and devotion, inspiring artists to explore her complex character through various artistic devices.</p>
  <p>In Italian painting, Mary Magdalene is often depicted as a penitent sinner, shown in solitude, prayer, or deep reflection. Artists emphasized her inner transformation – from a woman with a troubled past to a saint of profound spiritual strength. She is frequently portrayed with long flowing hair (symbolizing both freedom and repentance), a skull (as a reminder of mortality), and a book or cross as signs of her faith.</p>
  <p>Many prominent Italian artists, such as Titian, Donatello, Caravaggio, Filippino Lippi, and Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo, portrayed Mary Magdalene, each bringing out different aspects of her character – passion, vulnerability, and spiritual intensity. For example, one of the most striking depictions of Mary Magdalene is Caravaggio’s <em>Penitent Magdalene</em> (c. 1594-1595), housed in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj in Rome. Departing from traditional portrayals, Caravaggio presents her as a contemporary Roman woman in quiet reflection. With her head bowed and a tear on her cheek, she sits among discarded jewelry and a jar of ointment – symbols of her renounced past. The dramatic use of chiaroscuro highlights her inner turmoil and spiritual awakening. Grounded in realism, the painting emphasizes Magdalene’s humanity and captures universal themes of repentance and redemption, showcasing Caravaggio’s innovative approach to religious art.</p>
  <p>Artistic representations of Mary Magdalene in Italian art became symbols of personal redemption, emotional honesty, and spiritual renewal. Through careful attention to human expression, light and shadow, and material detail, artists sought not just to depict a saintly ideal, but a living soul – relatable and deeply human. These works occupy a special place in Italy’s religious and artistic tradition, continuing to inspire with their portrayal of faith, inner struggle, and grace.</p>

  Few artworks depicting Saint Mary Magdalene are preserved in the ArCo (Italian Cultural Heritage Knowledge Graph) database – a major digital archive of Italy’s cultural heritage.
</p>
<p>
  Below, I present how I attempted to enrich the ArCo ontology, along with several example queries executed through the SPARQL Query Editor.

        The SPARQL request I used here was to find how many paintings of Maria Magdalena are there in the ArCo. According to the ArCo, there are 5219 artworks with this Biblical figure. The answer seems to be accurate.

        This query was intended to list artworks of Mary Magdalene located in Rome. Unfortunately, it returned no results, although such artworks exist in the ArCo database. This may be due to limitations in how location data is structured or queried.

      <td style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; text-align: justify;">
        This query was made to test whether ArCo can return specific types of artworks, such as statues of Maria Maddalena. It worked only when the term “statua” was used in the title, showing a limitation in querying by artwork type.

</table>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the process of analyzing the ArCo database, searches were conducted to identify artworks depicting Mary Magdalene were located specifically in Rome. Although this information is present in the ArCo database (can be found under the section “coverage”) – for example, it is known that <em>Santa Maria Maddalena</em> by Bartolomeo Vivarini is held in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj in Rome — the SPARQL queries failed to retrieve results that combine both the subject (Mary Magdalene) and the location (Rome). Multiple versions of SPARQL code were tested, including variations using different ontology properties such as <code>hasLocation</code> and <code>coverage</code>, but none produced the expected results.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This suggests a structural limitation or inconsistency in how linked data is implemented within ArCo, particularly in connecting subject metadata with geographic information. To address this, we propose semantic enrichment of the database. As a demonstrative case, we manually encoded the metadata for various artworks of Mary Magdalene in RDF format, adding explicit details about its current location in a format compatible with the ArCo ontology.
