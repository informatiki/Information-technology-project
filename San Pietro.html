    Saint Peter and His Significance in Italian Christian Culture
Saint Peter, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, holds a foundational role in Christian tradition. Regarded as the first Bishop of Rome, he is widely considered the first pope by the Roman Catholic Church. According to the New Testament, Jesus entrusted Peter with the leadership of the early Church, symbolically referring to him as the "rock" upon which the Church would be built.

In Italian Christian culture, Saint Peter is deeply revered not only for his apostolic authority but also for his martyrdom in Rome during the reign of Emperor Nero. Tradition holds that he was crucified upside down on Vatican Hill and buried where St. Peter’s Basilica now stands—a major pilgrimage site and a central symbol of Catholicism.

Saint Peter’s image has played a central role in Italian visual and religious culture. He is often depicted holding keys, symbolizing the authority to bind and loose. Renowned artists such as Michelangelo, Caravaggio, and Guido Reni created iconic representations of Peter in painting and sculpture.

In this project, I aim to explore how the image of Saint Peter is represented in the ArCo database -  </p>
