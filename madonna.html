  <h1>Mariia – Maria Vergine</h1>
  <p>
    The Virgin Mary is one of the central figures in Christian iconography and a key image in the history of Italian art. Her image has inspired painters, sculptors, stained glass artists and architects for centuries. Virtually every region of Italy has works dedicated to the Madonna, from Byzantine icons to Renaissance altarpieces and Baroque sculptures.

The choice of the theme associated with the image of the Virgin Mary is due to her exceptional role in shaping both the religious and artistic tradition of Italy. Mary was portrayed as mother, queen, intercessor, the ideal of female virtue. Her iconography is rich in symbols - the infant Christ, lilies, angels, radiance, throne, dove - each of which has a deep spiritual significance.

In addition, Madonna images played an important role in social and political life: icons and statues were used in processions, patronized cities (e.g., Siena and Florence), and placed in cathedrals, monasteries, and private homes. They were not only objects of worship, but also elements of visual communication of faith.

In this project, I aim to explore how the image of the Virgin Mary is represented in the ArCo database - and what information about her is missing or insufficiently revealed. This not only allows me to explore Italy's rich artistic heritage, but also to identify where current digital databases need to be supplemented. The Madonna image was the starting point for building semantic data enrichment through RDF and artificial intelligence.<p>
