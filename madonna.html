  <h1>Mariia – Maria Vergine</h1>

  <p><strong>Chosen theme:</strong> Works of art with the representation of the Virgin Mary (Madonna)</p>

  <p>
    I chose this topic because the Virgin Mary holds a central role in both religious and cultural heritage in Italy.
    Her image is a recurring theme in Italian art history, appearing in countless paintings, sculptures, and architectural decorations across centuries.
    Representations of the Madonna, especially those executed in tempera, are key to understanding religious devotion and artistic techniques of the past.
  </p>

  <p>
    I began with SPARQL queries in the ArCo database to retrieve relevant works:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>All artworks related to subjects containing “madonna”, “maria”, or “vergine”</li>
    <li>Artworks executed in <em>tempera</em> technique</li>
    <li>Count of objects in ArCo using <em>tempera</em> technique</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The SPARQL queries revealed a key limitation: no works were found that had both the <strong>tempera technique</strong> and an explicit subject referencing the Madonna.
    This reflects a <strong>knowledge gap</strong> in the data structure.
    To address this, I enriched the dataset with additional information.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, I reconstructed data about the <strong>“Maestà” by Duccio di Buoninsegna</strong>,
    a masterpiece executed in tempera and gold on wood, created for the altar of Siena Cathedral.
    While not listed in ArCo with those combined attributes, it is a cornerstone of Italian Marian iconography.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using Large Language Models (LLMs), I extracted iconographic details, historical context, and cultural function of the work,
    which I then translated into RDF using ArCo-compatible vocabulary.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Semantic enrichment:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Technique: tempera</li>
    <li>Material: wood, gold leaf</li>
    <li>Subject: Madonna and Child</li>
    <li>Iconography: Maestà composition</li>
    <li>Function: High altar devotion object in Siena Cathedral</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This approach demonstrates how structured data can be meaningfully expanded using AI and semantic technologies,
    providing deeper insights into Italy’s artistic legacy.
